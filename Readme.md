# Hello World

This is my work on computer vision. The aim of this repo is to test if the use of Computer Vision results better as opposed to Machine Learning as there are always pros and cons of each.

for example:
- If memory is an issue, prefer soft CV techniques to identify objects.
- If ambiguity is an issue, prefer machine learning.
- If speed is an issue, prefer CV
- If flexibility is desired, ML tends to do better.
- blah blah and so on...

The thing is, for solving a single problem there exist a very many ways but it is upto our limitations and resources that set our preference.

Another aim of this repo is to teach. I have been learning a lot lately. I have worked on grading and segmentating defects in potatoes as it was my major project in the Final Year. Thus naturally I encounterd a lot of new things that I didn't know before. The Feynman technique state that teaching something after learning is a great way to understand and remember that stuff, hence the motive!


## Object measurement 
The [**`scale_calculation`**](https://github.com/nikhilpandey360/Applied_Computer_vision/tree/master/scale_calculation) shows how to calculate scale or in other word how to measure using computer vision. In it we have used an object as marker to determine the length of the other object. It is coupled with [**`object_measurement`**](https://github.com/nikhilpandey360/Applied_Computer_vision/tree/master/object_measurement). Together, they provide an effective way of measuring a segmented object.
